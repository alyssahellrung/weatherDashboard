# Homework 06: Weather Dashboard

## DESCRIPTION
A weather application for travelers. When users enter a city into the search field and click the search button, the current weather conditions (including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index) and five-day forecast for that city are displayed. Users can also click on a previously searched city if they wish to view the weather there again. 

## TECHNOLOGIES
Built in Visual Studio using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, jQuery, OpenWeather, Font Awesome, and Moment.js

## ASSESSMENT
This seemingly-simple project required me to use many techniques I have learned so far and teach myself new ones as well (such as using multiple APIs at one time).
